"Project Orion" is a complete ROS 2 software stack for a custom-built, Mecanum-wheeled Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV).

This repository runs a **high-fidelity "Digital Twin"** of the robot. This means that instead of a physics simulation (like Gazebo), we are running the robot's actual control software and visualizing its state in real-time in RViz. It's a virtual copy that perfectly mirrors the real robot's geometry, sensors, and intended motion.

This platform is designed for students who want to build advanced projects on a robust foundation without starting from scratch.

To understand this project, it's helpful to know how the physical robot and the software are structured.

### The Hardware Hierarchy

The physical Orion UGV uses a multi-computer setup:
*   üß† **The Brain (NVIDIA Orin Nano):** Runs the main ROS 2 system and all high-level software nodes.
*   ü¶æ **The I/O Hub (Teensy 4.1):** Acts as a real-time bridge. It takes commands from the Orin and generates the precise PWM signals to control the wheel motors.
*   ‚öñÔ∏è **The IMU Co-processor (Arduino):** A dedicated board that processes data from the 9-DOF IMU sensor.

### The Software Packages

The code is organized into four main ROS 2 packages:
*   `ugv_description`: Contains the 3D model (URDF/XACRO) of the robot, based on its real-world CAD files.
*   `ugv_hardware`: The crucial hardware interface node that communicates with the Teensy over USB serial to send motor commands and receive IMU data.
*   `ugv_teleop`: A simple keyboard teleoperation node to drive the robot by publishing `/cmd_vel` messages.
*   `ugv_bringup`: Contains the master `launch` file to start the entire system with a single command.

This guide assumes you have completed our `ros2_tutorial_ws` and understand the basic workflow.

### 4.1 - Install Dependencies

This project requires a few extra ROS 2 packages. Open a terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
#For Software
# Install xterm, which our launch file uses to open a new terminal for keyboard control
sudo apt install xterm
```
```bash
#For full stack with Hardware
# Install the Robot Localization package (used for sensor fusion)
sudo apt install ros-humble-robot-localization

# Install the IMU Tools package (for working with IMU data)
sudo apt install ros-humble-imu-tools
```

### 2. Clone and Build the Project
```bash
# In you home directory or wherever,
# Clone this repository from the SG-Robotics-Open-Source organization
git clone https://github.com/SG-Robotics-Open-Source/ros2_orion_ws

# Navigate back to the root of your workspace to build
cd ~/ros2_tutorial_ws

# Build the project using colcon
colcon build 
```
### 3. Source and Launch the Digital Twin
To run the software-only simulation, you will use the teleop_rviz.launch.py file. This file starts everything you need (RViz, robot_state_publisher, teleop, and the forward_kinematics simulator) without trying to connect to any hardware.
```bash  
# Source your workspace in your terminal
source install/setup.bash

# Launch the dedicated simulation file
ros2 launch ugv_bringup teleop_rviz.launch.py
```

## How to Know It's Working
After running the launch command, an **RViz** window will open. You have successfully launched the digital twin if you see the following:

1.  **The Robot Model:** The detailed 3D model of the Orion UGV is rendered in the center of the grid.
2.  **The TF Tree:** You'll see the robot's coordinate frames (like `base_link`, `imu_link`, and the wheel frames). These show the geometric relationships between all parts of the robot.
3.  **Driving the Digital Twin:**
    *   Make sure the terminal where you ran the `launch` command is selected.
    *   Use the keyboard keys (`u`, `i`, `o`, etc.) to drive the robot.
    *   You will see the robot model move within RViz. The wheels will spin, and the `base_footprint` will glide across the grid.

**What you are seeing is the end-to-end data flow:** Your keyboard creates a `Twist` message, the hardware interface calculates the kinematics, and `robot_state_publisher` visualizes the result in RViz. This confirms the entire foundational software stack is working correctly.

## For Hardware Users (Advanced)

This repository also contains other launch files, such as digital_twin.launch.py. These files are intended for use with the physical Orion robot.

They are different because they also start the hardware_interface_node, which will actively try to connect to the Teensy microcontroller via a USB port (/dev/ttyACM0). If you run these launch files without the hardware connected, they will not work as expected.
